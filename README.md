# Monitoring of Bottle Manufacturing Process

This is an interactive dashboard that I made while taking the **Coursera's IBM Data Analytics with Excel and R**. The dashboard was made in **IBM Cognos Analytics**.  

* Identified key metrics to effectively monitor the bottle manufacturing process of a fictional industrial manufacturing.
* Constructed a data module that contains datasets from various data sources (Excel, CSV files).     
> In IBM Cognos Analytics, a data module is a container that describes data and rules for combining and shaping data to prepare it for analysis and visualization.
* The data sources were provided by the Coursera online training of Data Visualizations and can only be viewed if you are taking their course. However, I included detailed documentation of the project to provide the necessary descriptions of the data sources, the dataset, the calculations used, and the dashboard's contents.
